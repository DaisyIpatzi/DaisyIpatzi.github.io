## Views on Future of a Data Scientist: Roles and Responsibilities

After critically reading the contributions of my colleagues in the "Collaborative Discussion 1", several of us (including myself) emphasize that Saxena (2021) begins his writing in a superficial and pessimistic way and I even consider that he tries a little to discourage the reader from delving, into this wonderful world.
For instance, Data Science requires an interdisciplinary team in practice, among others: people who have in-depth knowledge of the subject to be developed or on which insights are intended to be generated, engineers, developers, designers, analysts, project managers, and for course, data scientists; all of these working on a common project and that despite the fact that there are super powerful libraries and programs that already develop multiple models or really trained models, the sensitivity on the subject to be developed, the ethical practices, the choice of the algorithm, the evolution of the data itself (as in the case of the new Covid-19 mutations), the maintenance of the model and the political and social implications, are managed by the human being. No server so powerful can replace the reason, nor the ethics of a human.

Firstly, what is a data scientist? According to Bowne-Anderson (2018), Data science is an emerging field that uses combined algorithms and scientific methods to draw out knowledge and gain insights from structured and unstructured data. Considering that Data Science is a relatively new and constantly evolving area of study, the role of the data scientist could also be changing. But in essence, some roles and responsibilities are:

Interdisciplinary collaboration with people from other backgrounds, depending on the industry in which we work.
Know and apply the principles of data protection laws and, behave ethically and socially responsible.
Transform information and gather (query) large volumes of data, analysing and be conscious of its behaviour. With the understanding that a Data Scientist can swim easily in programming languages such as Python or manipulate databases such as SQL.
Implement, maintain, and evaluate models and strategies, based on data and analysis.
Below are not necessarily responsibilities that a data scientist must develop actively but, it is a must to have knowledge and full understanding:
Data architecture: establishment of models, policies, and rules to manage data.
Data modelling & design: database design, implementation, and technical support management.
Data governance: planning, supervision, and control in the management and use of data.
Data storage: definition of the storage location, and the amount and type of data to be stored.
Data security: protection of privacy and confidentiality.
Among many other things!
That is why data science is important, because from the treatment of this data it can generate information that can be used to make better decisions and create more innovative products or services, in addition to allowing autonomous learning models to 'educate' themselves Big Data instead of relying, as was previously done. Data science is challenging due to the advanced nature that analytics involves in these times. Sounds exciting!
