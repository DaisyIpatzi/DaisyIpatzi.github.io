## Exploring Ethical Dilemmas in Tech: A Closer Look at Dark UX Patterns

In the field of technology, computing professionals frequently face ethical dilemmas that demand a thoughtful approach guided by ethical principles. Among these challenges is the issue of dark UX patterns, which aim to mislead users for financial advantage. 

According to Luguri and Strahilevitz (2020), dark patterns are user interfaces whose designers knowingly confuse users, make it difficult for users to express their actual preferences, or manipulate users into taking certain actions. In Mexico, where I am from, a clear example of this is seen in ATMs, where users end up being nudged into donations or accepting offers without really meaning to. It’s not just a matter of ethics; it affects people’s finances too.

Both, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of Ethics and the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct emphasize integrity as a fundamental principle for computing professionals. Integrity requires maintaining honesty and preservation ethical standards in all actions. In this scenario, the implementation of dark UX patterns to deceive users for financial gain clearly violates this principle. Such actions undermine the trust that users place in technology and digital services, eroding the integrity of the professionals involved.

Furthermore, both codes stress the importance of considering the public interest and the well-being of society. Computing professionals have a responsibility to prioritize the welfare of users over short-term financial gains, by prioritizing profits over user well-being and potentially avoid discriminating against visually impaired individuals with inaccessible design changes. As stated by Vistisen and Jensen (2013), there is a need to understand design as a development of empathy for a given user or group of users by giving a cased-based overview of how empathy can be achieved during the design process.

The implementation of dark UX patterns not only raises ethical concerns but could also lead to legal challenges, particularly in jurisdictions with robust consumer protection laws. Computing professionals must ensure that their actions comply with both legal regulations and ethical principles to maintain trust and accountability within the industry.

Overall, upholding integrity, considering the public interest, and complying with legal and ethical standards are essential for fostering trust and promoting the well-being of users in the digital age. By aligning their actions with these principles, computing professionals can contribute to a more ethical and responsible technology landscape.
