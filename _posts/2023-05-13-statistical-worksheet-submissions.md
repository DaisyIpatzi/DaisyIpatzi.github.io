# Statistical Worksheet Submissions

This chapter consolidates the Statistical Worksheet Submissions from Units 6, 7, 8 and 9. Each section presents the results, analyses, and links to download the relevant Excel files.

##  Quantitative Methods - Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

**Exercise 6.1.** See the below results, where the sample standard deviation of the weight loss for Diet A is s = 2.536 kg. Since the mean weight loss is a little larger than 2s, then a high proportion of those individuals on Diet A had a positive weight loss, again emphasising the effectiveness of the diet. Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the relative effectiveness of the two weight-reducing diets?

| Metric | Diet A  | Diet B  |
|--------|---------|---------|
| n      | 50      | 50      |
| Mean   | 5.341   | 3.710   |
| SD     | 2.536   | 2.769   |

**Analysis**

**Mean Weight Loss**: Diet A has a higher mean weight loss (5.341 kg) compared to Diet B (3.710 kg), indicating that, on average, individuals on Diet A lost more weight than those on Diet B.

**Standard Deviation**: The standard deviations are somewhat close, with Diet A at 2.536 kg and Diet B at 2.769 kg. This indicates that the weight loss results for both diets are spread around the mean in a similar manner, although Diet B's results are slightly more variable.

**Effectiveness of the Diets**: Given the higher average weight loss in Diet A, it can be considered more effective for weight loss compared to Diet B based on this sample. The consistency (as measured by the standard deviation) is similar for both diets, suggesting that the primary difference lies in the average effectiveness rather than in the variability of the results.

**Conclusion**
Diet A appears to be more effective than Diet B in terms of average weight loss achieved by the participants. The analysis suggests that individuals looking to lose more weight might prefer Diet A over Diet B, based on the data provided.

**Exercise 6.2.** Obtain the sample median, first and third quartiles and the sample interquartile range of the weight loss for Diet B. Place these results in the block of cells F26 to F29, using the same format as that employed for the Diet A results in the above example. Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the relative effectiveness of the two weight-reducing diets?

| Metric | Diet A  | Diet B  |
|--------|---------|---------|
| n      | 50      | 50      |
| Mean   | 5.341   | 3.710   |
| SD     | 2.536   | 2.769   |

**Analysis**

**Mean Weight Loss**: Diet A has a higher mean weight loss (5.341 kg) compared to Diet B (3.710 kg), indicating that, on average, individuals on Diet A lost more weight than those on Diet B.

**Standard Deviation**: The standard deviations are somewhat close, with Diet A at 2.536 kg and Diet B at 2.769 kg. This indicates that the weight loss results for both diets are spread around the mean in a similar manner, although Diet B's results are slightly more variable.
