## GDPR Regulation and Data Protection rules as a Trust-Enabler in the EU and Beyond

It is extremely enriching to read the contributions made in the Collaborative Learning Discussion (of Essex Online), especially since we all have different backgrounds, nationalities, and most of us have been working for different industries. First, I would like to keep pointing out that amid the era of globalization, the rapid technological evolution poses new challenges for the protection of personal data; we are faced with powerful technological tools for data protection in the digital ecosystem and plus, data is the gold of the 21st century for many companies. My research has found that 71% countries have legislation around the world, (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 2021).

**Few benefits:**

* The European Union considers that privacy is a fundamental right of citizens that must be protected.
* With the GDPR, the rights and freedoms of citizens are extended, paying special attention to minors
* The principle of proactive responsibility establishes that companies must apply technical and organisational measures to assure citizens that we respect those rights and freedoms
* The risk approach allows us to adjust these measures to our circumstances
Complying with the GDPR means that companies act ethically in an aspect that is especially sensitive for the population, so our reputation will be reinforced

**How to be Prepared?**

* Understand the GDPR legal framework
* Create a data registry: Each country has a Data Protection Association (DPA), which will be responsible for enforcing the GDPR
* Classify data: Find personally identifiable information (PII)
* Start with the top priority: With any data or application, the first priority should be to protect the privacy of the user.
* Assess and document additional risks and processes
* Review and repeat
