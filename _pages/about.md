## Hello!

This is Daisy! A Data enthusiastic, with more than 13 years of experience across different industries (banking, airlines, startups and technology).

I love the whole process of leading, gathering, interpreting data and generating insightful recommendations from a variety of sources to help the organization improve the quality of the business necessities.

I am currently working as a Senior Data Analyst at [Sourceability](https://sourceability.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=daisy&utm_id=daisy_personal) and studying for my MSc Data Science at  [University of Essex](https://online.essex.ac.uk/)
