## Hello!

This is Daisy! A Data enthusiastic, with more than 10 years of experience across different industries (banking, airlines and technology).

I just love the whole process of leading, gathering, interpreting data and generating insightful recommendations from a variety of sources to help the organization improve the quality of the business necessities.
